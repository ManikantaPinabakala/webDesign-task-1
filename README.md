## Web Design Task - Medibuddy Website

- I built this website as an assignment work for an interview. This website is built using:

  - React (Vite + React)
  - TypeScript
  - shadcn (for UI components)
  - Tailwind CSS (for styling)
  - react-icons (for some additional components)

# Setup details:

  - Initially, the app is created using `npx create-vite@latest` command
  - Then, we can configure `tailwind` with Vite following the commands from the official documentation of <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/vite" target="_blank">this</a> Tailwind website
  - Then, we can similarly configure `shadcn` following <a href="https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation/vite" target="_blank">this</a> official documentation of shadcn
  - Then, we can install `react-icons` using `npm i react-icons`
  - Additional requirements / dependencies can be found in the `package.json` file of this repository
